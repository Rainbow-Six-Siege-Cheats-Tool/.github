* **Custom profiles:** Adjust sensitivity and aim curves per weapon class
* **Smart detection:** Prevents aim flick and unnatural crosshair jumps

### 2. ESP Overlay (Wall Vision)

* **ESP Layers:** Player boxes, skeleton view, item glow
* **Color coding:** Enemies (red), allies (blue), gadgets (yellow)
* **Range filter:** Adjustable up to 300m

### 3. Radar Module

A compact radar interface to visualize nearby opponents even through obstacles. Perfect for tracking rotations and flanks.

### 4. Configurable Loadouts

Easily save, import, or export your configuration JSONs:

```json
{
  "aimbot": { "fov": 4.8, "smooth": 0.32 },
  "esp": { "distance": 250, "color_enemy": "#FF0000" },
  "hotkeys": { "toggle": "F3", "panic": "End" }
}
```

### 5. Safe Injection System
